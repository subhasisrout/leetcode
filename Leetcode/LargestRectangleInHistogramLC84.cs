// #RememberPattern
// This solution found in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0do2734xhnU
// is more #intuitive than #AlgoExpert #AE.
// This is mainly dividing the solution into 3 parts - finding lb, finding rb and calculating areas.
// find lb and rb can be done using brute force by looking all elements, all time. This uses Stack.
// Note lb[0] is -1 because we are storing index of "next smaller element". similarly rb[lastindex] = totalLength.
